# Project 1: How I thought my browsing history changed with the Lede Programme

I have analysed my web browsing data in Safari for two specific periods: 2 months prior to the Lede Prgramme (May 22-June 4, 2023) and two weeks into the programme (June 5-18, 2023) to understand how my browsing history changed over time.

I found how the number of webpages I visit have trippled over time and how almost half of the webpages are general-interest sites and have nothing to do with the programme.

## Data and analysis methodology
I scrapped my safari history using history.db file and then used pandas to clean the dataset.
Finally, I used pivot table in excel to create the data for the visualisations

## Webpage design
I have used Bootstrap for styling the webpage and used Datawrapper to create the visuals. For one of the visuals, I have reworked the Datawrapper visual in Adobe Indesign to make it fit on page.
